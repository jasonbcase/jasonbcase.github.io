		<h1>Hello everyone</h1>
		<h2><a href="http://a-way-to-go.com/"> A Way to Go</a></h2>
		<p>I chose this website because i thought it was quite interesting. They effectively immerse you into the world that they have created. You start of on a screen which asks you if you would like
		to go on an adventure. Then the website asks to disable your cursor. The website works using your mouse movement to control the camera view while the "w" key makes the figure walk while the "e" key makes the character run
		and the spacebar makes the character jump; your character can also fly by moving the mouse upward. Clicking and jumping creates tones that blend with the music.
		Once your adventure begins your are transported to a black and white forest. You are a crudely drawn paper man and you are standing in front of an illuminated path. Your character runs through the black and white
		forest as a dark character chases you. As you are running it seems as if you are running through a real forrest the whole experience is quite surreal. The website has a very creepy 
		feel to it with the contrast of animation and reality. </p>

		<p> I chose this website because I really enjoyed the flush look of the pictures that they use on their site. I like how they take up the entire space of the browser. I also really like how the type lays over a white background as if the type is floating. They enforce this floating ice with pictures that follow text and nothing connects the white space to the colorful squares that hold the pictures.</p>

	<p> Frankensim is just a fun is that I like. I just like the retro look of the pop art when you double click on it. I also like the way that the animations are simplistic so that they donâ€™t become too distracting. I also like the idea that the user can come up with os many different outcomes. I also really like that the colors change when you click the mouse.</p>
